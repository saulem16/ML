Renting or buying a new home, whether you are a university student or a middle-class family, is always a complex process that often seems impulsive. As a student, I faced the problem of finding a decent rental housing. Thanks to internet sites nowadays we can search for an apartment on our own, rental services provide data through their websites. 
In this project Iâ€™m going make algorithm that will predict price of rental places in Almaty based on other information like the number of rooms, distance from center of Almaty, area, etc.
